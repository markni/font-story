A Font Story of Github
========================

**Font Story** is a dynamic "info-typographic" generated by analysing Github's public events data.

By parsing through css/less/scss files in public repos, we are able to take a glance of How today's developer/designer use typography in web projects.

This simple projects aimed to answer these questions (for now):

- **What are the most used fonts around the web right now?**
- **Should I use sans-serif font or serif font? Why?**
- **I'm using bootstrap, which font based icon-set should I use?**
- **There is a font I really like to use, but I'm worrying about its backwards compatibility. What fonts should I use as fallbacks?**
