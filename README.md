A Font Story of Github ![build](https://travis-ci.org/xna2/font-story.svg?branch=master)
========================

**Font Story** is a dynamic "info-typographic" generated by analysing Github's public events data.

By parsing through css/less/scss files in public repos, we are able to take a glance of How today's developer/designer use typography in web projects.

This simple projects aimed to answer these questions (for now):

- What are the most used fonts around the web right now?
- Should I use sans-serif font or serif font? Why?
- I'm using bootstrap, which font based icon-set should I use?
- There is a font I really like to use, but I'm worrying about its backwards compatibility. What fonts should I use as fallback?
